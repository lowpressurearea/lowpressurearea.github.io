                  <p>"All the demons we hide, we are slowly uncovering... Constantly Learning" - Gabby Alipe</p>
                  <br />

                  <p>GEUSELF made me realize that all of us are in the constant cycle of learning and finding genuinity, authenticity, and our role in the world we live in. Now, I would like to discuss "myself" in the form of a "Narrative Knowing". As much as I would like to discuss this in a more "heartfelt" way (what???), I think tackling the concepts which I find myself more immersed/related to one by one is better. The first concept I would like to discuss would be the first perspective of the self: The Philosophical perspective, specifically Heidegger's & Satre's concept of Authenticity. Authenticity is one factor and this is about knowing oneself by being true and honest with yourself and others, exhibiting credibility in words and actions, and avoiding pretenses. In terms of my progress in this perspective, I think I'm still trying to "narrow down" and pursue what is next on what I truly want. A term left before I become a 3rd year, I would say that I'm in the right degree but still unsure with what's next for me after my academics/career path. I think authenticity doesn't just end with doing what you love currently but also having a vision for the future (which I'm still figuring out). The next perspective I would like to discuss is the sociological perspective. Based on Callero's paper (2003), the concept of social constructs specifically about identity, I was able to examine the societal norms and institutional influences that impact my sense of self. Influences don't just end in the four corners of a classroom and are in fact brought by which "herd" one is following with. One thing I would also like to add up as well is the concept of power in society. Personally, I was more immersed in activism in college than when I was in highschool. Contemplating power dynamics and reflexivity within the sociological perspective encourages me to critically assess the power structures and social hierarchies that exist, making my mind open and aware of the injustices in our surroundings which are set by our own government's incompetencies. The last perspective I would like to discuss would be the Oriental perspective. A little share on my end (hehe) but I am slowly trying to incorporate the concept of the 5 skandhas in my life for my well-being. I remember it being discussed and I voluntarily read more about it out of curiosity.  It has allowed me to cultivate a deeper sense of self-awareness and mindfulness in my experiences. By recognizing the interplay of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness, I've gained a better understanding of my thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. I was able to grow more holistically and kinda gave me a "hold" or control on my own feelings and experiences. Acknowledging my feelings as Feelings (Vedana) & Impulses or Mental Formations (Sankhara) has empowered me to develop emotional regulation skills, particularly when facing academic challenges and navigating social interactions. Balancing physical well-being (form), emotional health (feelings), cognitive development (perceptions and consciousness), and mental resilience (mental formations) can contribute to a more balanced and fulfilling mindset towards life. I find my philosophical self and my oriental self coinciding in my decisions. 

                     <br /><br>

                     The last three that I would like to discuss are more on the deconstructed self specifically the Physical, Economic, and Digital Self. I chose these three because I believe it's the most prevalent in Lasallian culture. In my two years in DLSU, I believe there's nothing more important than your face, your socio-economic status, and how they would see or perceive you online. My fair share for these thoughts came from my experiences in the dating culture (especially in my "fuck around and find out era" back in my first year). As we all know, I'm a vertically challenged person (hehe) and my height is something I have no control of. I've been turned down on by some women I talked to before because I was just not "tall" enough at one point I got a backhanded compliment "Okay ka sana at medyo cute kaso cute din height mo eh" which got me thinking like wtf??? Although i've been in relationships already, I still get called out/filtered by my height but in the long run I also learned how to accept it. The next thing I would like to discuss would be the importance of socio-economic status. Getting in and knowing different girls from La Salle got me always thinking "Damn... I'm out of her league". Although I met someone who doesn't care about my background, I think socio-economic status is still a big thing in dating as it also reflects on one's lifestyle. I'll be honest, I'm a frugal person so if I'm dating someone who likes to spend on her free time, I'm going to have a hard time catching up. Lastly, would be about the Digital Self. Dating online is like "selling" yourself to be honest. It also kind of coincides with your physical self as people tend to approach you based on their first impressions about your face. Because of this, catfishes and similar identity fraud are happening just for them to be able to satisfy their type. I personally never experienced getting catfished a few of my friends had.
